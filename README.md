# dice-game

Inspired by Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" dice game challenge, with small tweaks of mine:
- used arrays instead of concatenation to iterate through dice pictures randomely (saved a few lines of code this way)
- added refresh button that acts like a "shake and throw dices" functionality
